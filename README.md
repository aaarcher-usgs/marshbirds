To use this repository, clone the documents onto your local device. Open the project with RStudio. Beginning with `programs/01_data.processing.R` or `programs_novisual/01_data_processing.R`, run through the scripts in numerical order and reproduce the analysis in the manuscript. The former directory has the main analysis in the manuscript whereas the latter directory has a sub-analysis that removes any visual-only bird detections. This latter analysis was done in response to a request by reviewers.
